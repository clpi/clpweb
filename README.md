# rust + wasm

This is just a repository to host my forays into using Rust + WASM for front-end (along side other back end) projects. for the time being, it also hosts my personal webpage and will also be the home to a bunch of small projects and experiments with some of the wasm frameworks currently available in the Rust ecosystm. Part of this is to see if it's worth considering adopting a full-stack Rust approach for web-rendered desktop apps / full stack web applications for larger projects
I'm working on in the future (as opposed to trying to keep current with the rapid-pace JavaScript landscape), when the rust + wasm ecosystem matures fully.

* pyew: **(current)** using for personal website, maybe creating a blog, creating some test projects
* ppercy: percy + rust
* psauron: sauron + rust
* pseed: seed + rust
* svets: trying out svelte for personal website now that it officially supports typescript -- also, since I already like and use Svelte, maybe try to recreate WASM apps in svelte and see how performance / dev exp differs
